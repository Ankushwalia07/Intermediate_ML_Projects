# Intermediate Machine Learning Projects

## Comment Toxic Classifier
- Description: A machine learning model designed to identify and classify toxic or harmful content in text comments.
- Training Data: Labeled dataset of toxic and non-toxic comments.
- Techniques Used: Natural language processing (NLP) techniques for text analysis and classification.

## Face Detection
- Description: A computer vision project that involves detecting and locating human faces in images or video streams.
- Techniques Used: Machine learning algorithms for analyzing visual patterns and features.
- Applications: Facial recognition systems, video surveillance, augmented reality.

## Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)
- Description: A class of machine learning models consisting of a generator and a discriminator, trained in an adversarial setting.
- Purpose: Generating realistic data samples, such as images, that can deceive the discriminator network.
- Applications: Image generation, data augmentation, creating deepfakes.

## Image Classifier
- Description: A machine learning model trained to classify or categorize images into different classes or labels.
- Techniques Used: Analyzing visual features and patterns in images.
- Applications: Object recognition, medical imaging, autonomous vehicles.
